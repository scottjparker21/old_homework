                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Last Spring me and a few friends flew out to Maryland for my friend Petes graduation party. We were in town for a few days and we all agreed it would be a lot of fun to hike/camp part of the Appalachian Trail. We haphazardly packed up two cars with a random assortment of alcohol and camping equipment and drove about 30 minutes to the trail..</p></br>
                            <!-- end p1 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We stopped at a local grocery store to pick up some food for the evening. Our plan was to hike in a few miles to a campsite that was right next to a huge bluff. About 15 minutes in we could tell we overpacked a bit. We had packed a collapsable fabric cooler with as much beer as possible it probably weigh about 80 pounds. Pete had two tents and both of them were gigantic and probably best suited for a family of twelve.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p2 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So we trudged, getting quite a few odd looks for serious hikers, down a particularly hilly portion of the Appalachian trail. Petes graduation party was the night before so weren’t in the best shape to be lugging heavy, overs-sized tents and beer coolers up steep trails. After about two hours of hiking we arrived at Annapolis Rock. After taking in the view for a while we hiked back towards the trail to pick out a camp site for the night.</p><br>
                          <!-- end p3 -->
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-6">
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is where our plan derailed. The signs leading into the campground clearly stated no campfires or alcohol. And there was a site care taker so breaking these rules wasn’t really an option. Pete had hiked and camped this portion of trail multiple times and had somehow forgotten this. To make things worse all the food we had brought needed to be cooked over a fire.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p4 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We decided to hike back out and go to a different campground where we could have a fire and refreshments. On the hike back we were giving each other trail names. Pete was dubbed Chief No Plan.</p></br>
