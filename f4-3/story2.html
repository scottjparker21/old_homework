                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It started out as a rather unexceptional night. I was back in my hometown for the summer like so many other college freshmen. My friend Appalonia (actual name can’t make this up) texted me and invited me to a bonfire at her parents house. I was with my friend…we’ll call him Hector. So me and hector picked up a handle of rum and headed to the party.</p></br>
                            <!-- end p1 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hector wasn’t someone who generally held his liquor well and as you’ll find out this particular night was no exception. We arrived at the party, the fire was blazing and everyone was having a good time. Hector and I were passing our bottle of shitty rum back and forth grimacing with each pull of cheap spicy liquor. After about an hour I noticed that the bottle was half full and Hector was acting pretty pickled. Hector started to slur incoherently and decided to take his socks off and throw them in the fire. When someone inquired why he burned a perfectly good pair of socks, he stumbled around while taking off his shirt and threw it in the fire as well. At this point I could only imagine what other shinanigans Hector had in store.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p2 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took off his pants. If front of a bunch of people. Everyone has one of those people in their friend group right? The guy who gets black out drunk and gets naked at parties? While we were all try to get him to put his pants back on before Appalonia’s parents came outside he decided the boxers had to burn as well. Then he proceeded to drunkenly trip and fall, face first, almost directly into the fire. At this point he was completely naked and down for the count.</p><br>
                          <!-- end p3 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because I had brought Hector to the party it was decided that I would have to be the one to put his pants back on. So, while averting my eyes I put my friends pants on much, like a caretaker of a coma patient might. At this point Appalonia had had enough and told me that we had to leave. I had drank quite a bit as well so a friend volunteered to give us a ride back to her house.</p><br>
                          <!-- end p4 -->
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-6">
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had to carry Hector like a 160 pound sack of potatoes and put him in the back seat of my two door car. When we got to my friends house she understandably didn’t want a half naked wasted guy in  her living room when her parents woke up and because he looked pretty comfortable we cracked the windows like any good dog owner and went inside to sleep.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p5 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next morning my friends dad woke us up and told me that my car had been broken into. So still half awake I walked through the front door and out onto the driveway. I saw Hector still passed out in the back seat and the rear driver side window of my car smashed on my friends driveway. Nestled in these sharp shards of glass was a pile of human shit.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p6 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although, Hector didn’t recall the specified details we pieced together that at some point during the night nature had called. Hector decided that using the unlocked car door instead he would use his bare feet to kick out the rear window, climb though it (judging by the scratches all over his arms and chest), and defecate (again barefoot) on the pile of glass.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p7 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My friend lived in a townhouse and her family and their neighbors shared the same driveway. While we were standing there trying to wrap our heads around what had happened her neighbors garage door opened. Her neighbor walked out seeming genuinely concerned about all the broken glass and wanting to know if she could help. When she got closer her eyes widened and she gasped “Oh my god is that shit” under her breath. She was in a rush to get to work and didn’t want to drive over broken glass so she gave Hector a push broom and told him to clean it up.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p8 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that’s how Hector started his day, with what I imagine was probably the worst hangover of his life, sweeping up glass and poo shirtless and shoeless. I’ll never forget the sight of it. I wanted to be mad but I couldn’t stop laughing. He still feels bad about and I had to drive around without a window for a couple days but can you really put a price on a funny story?</p></br>
