                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few years back my parents went on vacation on asked if I could watch the house for the weekend and take care of the family dog. The second day I was there I woke up and walked to the bathroom to take a shower. I turned on the faucet and waited for the water to warm up. At this point I realized I had forgotten to grab a towel so I started to walk back to my room.</p></br>
                            <!-- end p1 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to open the door but the handle had inexplicably broken and I couldn’t get it to budge. After a few puzzling moments I realized the only way I was getting out of that bathroom was if I kicked the door down. I had also left my cellphone in my room so calling for help wasn’t an option. My parents wouldn’t be back for another day so I had to take action.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p2 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I decided I would crawl out onto the second story roof of my house and see if any other windows were unlocked. The problem with this was that I didn’t have any clothes (We have neighbors so walking around on my roof naked wasn’t an option). So I started to look for something to wear. No one had really used this bathroom since my sisters and I moved out. The only thing I could find was an old bathrobe that was much more suited for a short teenage girl than a 6’3 guy. But hey beggers can’t be choosers.</p><br>

                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Things rarely go as planned and this was no exception. I nailed the soaring through the air part but misread the wind and ended up landing barefoot on a pinecone. The excruciating pain threw off my groove and instead of doing a perfectly executed tuck and roll I found myself crumpled in a heap of embarrassment on my front lawn.</p></br>
                          <!-- end p5 -->
                          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I walked inside praying that my neighbors hadn’t witnessed this unfortunate series of events. When my parents got home the next day my Dad was more concerned with the bathroom door than my well being. It wouldn’t budge on the outside either so he sent to the hardware store to buy a new door handle and made me fix it.</p></br>
